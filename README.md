## How this project works?

This searching engine can be regarded as a GUI of [OMDb database](http://www.omdbapi.com/). You can enter their conditions (shown as the left screenshot), then choose one exact result (shown as the middle screenshot) and check its details (shown as the right screenshot).

For example, if you want to search movie *[A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chinese_Odyssey)*, just enter name condition `A Chinese Odyssey` (type condition `Movie` is optional). The searching procedure is as following:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img alt="4" src="docs/screenshots/4.png">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

When choosing one result to check its details, the searching engine will search again using IMDb ID as new searching condition.
